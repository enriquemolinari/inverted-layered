# Inverted Layered Architecture Style 

This is an example of the "almost" hexagonal architecture style, called Inverted Layered, written as a demostration for the book [Coding an Architecture Style](https://leanpub.com/codinganarchitecturestyle).

The book is completely **free** for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
